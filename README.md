# Rubik-s-cube-solver

#### A programme simulates the assembly of a 3x3 Rubik's cube, implemented with a graphical application interface using the *OpenGL Utility Toolkit*.

The programme has the following functional requirements:
* save and read the rubik's cube state from a file
* check that the current state is correct
* display the current state on the console
* rotating the rubik's cube faces with the input commands
* generating a random Rubik's Cube state, correct from the point of view of the state invariant
* finding the solution for the current state as a sequence of rotation of the faces
